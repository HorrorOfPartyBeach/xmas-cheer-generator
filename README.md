# Create Christmas!ðŸŽ„


Welcome to the repo for my random Christmas picture generator app!

I had the idea because I wanted to work on my React skills and create a project that I could later refactor using React Hooks. Since it's so miserable out, I thought "Why not make it festive and spread a little cheer?"

My MVP was an app which allows the user to press a button and generate a new Christmas picture each time. I hope to add more features and expand it over the Christmas season.

A deployed version of the app can be found at https://createchristmas.netlify.com/
